# SetCover


The minimum set cover problem is considered as a NP-Hard Problem. Our main objective is to find the minimum number of food courts to cover all the buildings in the particular street/area.Because nowadays people will travel to different places to get their food when needful. So we will pick some buildings and formulate the problem of opening food courts of these selected buildings. We connect these two with threshold time based on distance between the buildings.
